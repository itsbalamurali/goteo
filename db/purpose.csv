Keep in mind, that as a general rule, most part of the project will have to be undertaken by the person or team that is promoting the project, and not subcontracted to third parties. For the calculation, have also in mind the commissions for WinnersFund's provision of services and for transaction, which add up to around 9% (<a href=""/faq/sponsor#q98"" target=""new"">+ info in our FAQ</a>). <br><br><strong>Very important</strong>: On WinnersFund, we differentiate among necessary and supplemental costs. The former must be totally covered in order to obtain funding, while the latter can be obtained as part of a second campaign, once the project is underway, in order to cover optimization costs (promotion, design, outreach, additional units, etc.) These supplemental costs can not be more than one half of the total cost of the project.",NULL,"general"

We believe that these are essential for starting a campaign to raise funds via WinnersFund.<br><br>Keep in mind that the most valuable thing to WinnersFund is: the free information and general knowledge that your project will bring to the community, the originality, the desire to answer a social need, the power to attract a wide community of interested people, making it clear that the promotion team has the capacity and experience to bring the project to fruition.
