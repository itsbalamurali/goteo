In the case of organizations, we recommend that the representative of the organization be formally accredited (for example, by way of the statutes or a certificate of the secretary with an OK from the president, in the case of associations)."
"guide-project-costs","en","<strong>In this section, you should fill out a short business plan based on the estimated costs for your project.</strong><br><br>You should break down the numbers by tasks, infrastructure, or materials. Try to be realistic about the costs and briefly explain why you need each one. Keep in mind, that as a general rule, most part of the project will have to be undertaken by the person or team that is promoting the project, and not subcontracted to third parties. For the calculation, have also in mind the commissions for SiteName's provision of services and for transaction, which add up to around 9% (<a href=""/faq/sponsor#q98"" target=""new"">+ info in our FAQ</a>). <br><br><strong>Very important</strong>: On SiteName, we differentiate among necessary and supplemental costs. The former must be totally covered in order to obtain funding, while the latter can be obtained as part of a second campaign, once the project is underway, in order to cover optimization costs (promotion, design, outreach, additional units, etc.) These supplemental costs can not be more than one half of the total cost of the project."
"guide-project-description","en","<strong>Use this section to explain the conceptual aspects of the project</strong><br><br>This is the first information that a visitor to the site will see. For that reason, we recommend being careful with editing and avoiding typos. You will see that there are required fields, including one for video and images. We believe that these are essential for starting a campaign to raise funds via SiteName.<br><br>Keep in mind that the most valuable thing to SiteName is: the free information and general knowledge that your project will bring to the community, the originality, the desire to answer a social need, the power to attract a wide community of interested people, making it clear that the promotion team has the capacity and experience to bring the project to fruition. So don't forget to give us information about all of these points."

Once the proposal is sent, no further changes are permitted.<br><br>Keep in mind that we can only choose a few projects per month in order to guarantee a certain amount of attention and promotion for those that are published. You will receive a message with all of this information shortly, which will indicate the next steps, as well as some recommendations that will help your project reach its proposed objectives."
"guide-project-rewards","en","<strong>In this section, you should establish what the project is offering to its co-financiers and also what the collective benefits will be.</strong><br><br>In addition to the individual rewards for each level of co-financing, you should define the kind of license that you will assign to the project, according to its format and/or level of openness (or that of its parts). This is very important, since SiteName is a crowdfunding platform for projects based on a philosophy of open source software and promotion of the common good.<br><br>In the event that in addition to one of the licenses specified here you would also like to register the intellectual property rights of your work or ideas, while maintaining its compatibility with collective benefits, you can get specific legal protection with <a href=""http://www.safecreative.org/"" target=""new"">Safe Creative</a>."
